1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,378

2
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:11,707
the final thing will look at in terms of combining queries is exclusion

3
00:00:12,447 --> 00:00:17,137
we used the exclusion activity to exclude unwanted query results

4
00:00:18,762 --> 00:00:23,607
most businesses typically have a standard definition of who they want to exclude from their target

5
00:00:24,481 --> 00:00:29,745
you can add a topology rule that will be applied during analysis to exclude these people

6
00:00:30,339 --> 00:00:35,425
but you can also exclude them upfront in your workflow to get a more accurate count

7
00:00:36,650 --> 00:00:38,654
to apply standard exclusions

8
00:00:38,909 --> 00:00:40,848
start with your target population

9
00:00:41,127 --> 00:00:46,928
and then define one or more additional queries to choose the recipients you want to exclude

10
00:00:47,574 --> 00:00:53,269
and then use an exclusion activity to exclude that group of people from the main target

11
00:00:57,073 --> 00:01:00,196
there are out of the box predefined user filters

12
00:01:00,326 --> 00:01:03,079
which are useful for excluding recipients

13
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:05,754
such as blacklisted email

14
00:01:05,886 --> 00:01:07,506
an email and quarantine

15
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:12,851
or you can always define your own filters to exclude recipients

16
00:01:13,063 --> 00:01:15,007
and then save them for reuse

17
00:01:18,627 --> 00:01:21,348
to define your own filter for reuse

18
00:01:21,605 --> 00:01:25,322
either go to the predefined filter folder and click new

19
00:01:25,643 --> 00:01:28,990
so from the explorer view under profiles and targets

20
00:01:29,464 --> 00:01:32,045
going to predefined filters and click new

21
00:01:32,708 --> 00:01:35,500
or you can edit a query activity

22
00:01:35,626 --> 00:01:40,368
define your filtering conditions and then save it as a predefined filter

23
00:01:40,883 --> 00:01:47,544
so you'll see save as highlighted it's right next to the distribution of values icon that's where you find the save option

24
00:01:48,491 --> 00:01:52,272
then you would simply give that predefined filter

25
00:01:52,473 --> 00:01:53,333
a label

26
00:01:54,102 --> 00:01:56,382
and then you can use that again in the future

27
00:01:57,357 --> 00:01:58,276
remember

28
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:02,546
the main thing for this type of filter

29
00:02:03,031 --> 00:02:06,868
is that you are filtering for people that you do not

30
00:02:07,079 --> 00:02:08,458
want to target

31
00:02:09,338 --> 00:02:17,364
for example you might not want to target anyone whose email was empty they'll get dropped from analysis know during the analysis period anyway

32
00:02:18,371 --> 00:02:21,698
or you might want to drop anyone that's an internal employee

33
00:02:22,005 --> 00:02:26,399
or if you have any adobe campaign consultants who are in your data mart

34
00:02:26,654 --> 00:02:28,948
as test records that sort of thing

35
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:34,219
or if you have any competitors in your database you might want to drop those domains

36
00:02:34,869 --> 00:02:35,272

37
00:02:35,421 --> 00:02:38,880
so that's the only tricky thing is that you are

38
00:02:39,029 --> 00:02:40,067
building of

39
00:02:40,192 --> 00:02:42,927
filter for people that you don't want a target

40
00:02:48,972 --> 00:02:50,925
then in your workflow

41
00:02:51,727 --> 00:02:54,335
you would add an exclusion activity

42
00:02:54,895 --> 00:02:57,735
and attach that exclusion activity

43
00:02:58,007 --> 00:03:01,639
to the query results in your workflow

44
00:03:03,501 --> 00:03:11,550
and the exclusion activity as we said the whole point is to remove one or more populations from the main population

45
00:03:12,095 --> 00:03:13,456
so as a result

46
00:03:13,722 --> 00:03:15,643
there should be the same number

47
00:03:15,818 --> 00:03:18,725
or fewer recipients in the primary set

48
00:03:18,946 --> 00:03:20,481
after an exclusion

49
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:27,034
so our example here we're looking for people who are over forty five and our first query

50
00:03:27,323 --> 00:03:31,316
and our second query were cheering for people whose email is empty

51
00:03:32,493 --> 00:03:38,340
now if we had the email address for all of those people who are forty five years and older

52
00:03:39,448 --> 00:03:42,999
we wouldn't be dropping anyone but in this example

53
00:03:43,216 --> 00:03:45,906
it looks like we went from a hundred and five

54
00:03:46,272 --> 00:03:47,662
forty five year olds

55
00:03:47,861 --> 00:03:49,297
down to ninety five

56
00:03:49,489 --> 00:03:52,721
so we were in fact missing some email addresses

57
00:03:52,865 --> 00:03:56,176
for those folks who are over forty five and our training environment

58
00:03:58,901 --> 00:03:59,928
now the one

59
00:04:00,117 --> 00:04:05,028
other important thing to note about an exclusion activity is that you must edit it

60
00:04:05,253 --> 00:04:07,907
so double click on the exclusion activity

61
00:04:09,909 --> 00:04:10,784
to add it

62
00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:15,592
when you double click on the exclusion activity this is what you see

63
00:04:16,472 --> 00:04:17,582
you must

64
00:04:17,793 --> 00:04:20,649
configure this by selecting

65
00:04:21,024 --> 00:04:22,911
the group that you want to keep

66
00:04:23,113 --> 00:04:25,643
so you must identify the primary set

67
00:04:26,282 --> 00:04:29,558
so in this case it would have been our men over forty five

68
00:04:29,793 --> 00:04:32,508
or in our example that we're going to build in the lab

69
00:04:32,666 --> 00:04:34,450
we'll keep our men

70
00:04:34,646 --> 00:04:37,996
under thirty who live in either new york or la

71
00:04:40,010 --> 00:04:41,917
you could if you want

72
00:04:42,403 --> 00:04:43,781
generate the compliment

73
00:04:43,902 --> 00:04:46,296
to see the people that fell out

74
00:04:46,673 --> 00:04:49,047
so the people that you're excluding

75
00:04:51,804 --> 00:04:54,393
so let's go do exercise for

76
00:04:54,794 --> 00:04:55,751
part five

77
00:04:55,973 --> 00:04:57,198
in our lab handbook

78
00:04:58,198 --> 00:05:02,511
we're going to add another query activity to our segmentation workflow

79
00:05:06,621 --> 00:05:08,662
an edit that query activity

80
00:05:12,330 --> 00:05:15,675
were to choose filtering conditions as the target type

81
00:05:20,143 --> 00:05:24,982
and we're gonna take advantage of the predefined filter that exists in here

82
00:05:25,342 --> 00:05:27,225
for blacklisted email address

83
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:29,281
and then we're gonna add some

84
00:05:29,391 --> 00:05:31,640
filtering criteria on top of that

85
00:05:32,423 --> 00:05:36,944
so rather than just adding an expression i'm going to click on the drop down arrow

86
00:05:37,282 --> 00:05:38,341
by ad

87
00:05:39,435 --> 00:05:41,893
and then scroll down to predefined filter

88
00:05:42,663 --> 00:05:47,038
and then take advantage of these predefined filters that come out of the box

89
00:05:47,614 --> 00:05:50,293
i'm in a pick blacklisted email address

90
00:05:50,827 --> 00:05:51,720

91
00:05:53,593 --> 00:05:56,624
i'm going to add another expression

92
00:05:57,837 --> 00:06:03,141
as we mentioned earlier by default every time you add an expression

93
00:06:03,675 --> 00:06:11,580
they are combined with an and to change this one i want this to be an or instead i'm simply gonna click on and

94
00:06:12,416 --> 00:06:13,178
and then

95
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,097
change this or

96
00:06:16,655 --> 00:06:19,504
for my second expression i'm gonna click in

97
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,650
edit the expression

98
00:06:25,615 --> 00:06:27,163
and i'm going to choose

99
00:06:27,315 --> 00:06:28,759
email

100
00:06:29,607 --> 00:06:31,126
choose the email attribute

101
00:06:31,969 --> 00:06:33,460
and for my operator

102
00:06:33,869 --> 00:06:36,132
i'm in a select is empty

103
00:06:41,141 --> 00:06:42,168
click finish

104
00:06:43,150 --> 00:06:44,117
and okay

105
00:06:46,763 --> 00:06:48,201
i can save that

106
00:06:48,451 --> 00:06:49,816
workflow if i would like

107
00:06:55,072 --> 00:06:59,455
next are gonna drag and exclusion activity from the targeting palette

108
00:07:01,493 --> 00:07:02,867
so exclusion

109
00:07:03,451 --> 00:07:04,349
drag that

110
00:07:04,757 --> 00:07:07,784
and i'm gonna attach it to my intersection

111
00:07:08,661 --> 00:07:16,096
and i am also going to attach my blacklisted email address or email is empty query to the exclusion activity

112
00:07:19,003 --> 00:07:24,128
now we just covered in the slides that you must edit the exclusion activity

113
00:07:24,534 --> 00:07:26,873
so we must double click on this

114
00:07:27,163 --> 00:07:30,153
and select the primary group that we are keeping

115
00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:35,279
so the primary set going to click the drop down arrow

116
00:07:36,306 --> 00:07:41,268
i don't want to keep the people who are blacklisted or whose email is empty

117
00:07:41,491 --> 00:07:48,079
i in fact want to keep the men under thirty who live in either new york or la so that's my intersection group

118
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:51,081
sentinel ct intersection

119
00:07:59,283 --> 00:08:00,511
and click ok

120
00:08:03,858 --> 00:08:06,223
and then i'm gonna restart that workflow

121
00:08:11,769 --> 00:08:12,500
click yes

122
00:08:20,466 --> 00:08:22,969
and it looks like we've dropped two people

123
00:08:23,553 --> 00:08:23,955

124
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:30,098
if i wanted to see who was dropped i could bring that information in by including

125
00:08:30,221 --> 00:08:31,676
the compliment

126
00:08:31,835 --> 00:08:34,116
so i could doubleclick on my exclusion

127
00:08:35,379 --> 00:08:37,668
check the box to generate the compliment

128
00:08:38,788 --> 00:08:39,954
click ok

129
00:08:40,759 --> 00:08:42,889
and i could restart this workflow

130
00:08:49,385 --> 00:08:52,805
and i could see who is in the complement group

131
00:08:53,021 --> 00:08:56,182
by then right clicking on this transition arrow

132
00:08:56,441 --> 00:08:57,813
displaying the target

133
00:08:58,673 --> 00:09:04,329
and i could see in fact that joe parker and francis jimenez have been excluded

134
00:09:05,435 --> 00:09:07,483
i could always configure my list

135
00:09:08,108 --> 00:09:09,343
to bring in

136
00:09:09,649 --> 00:09:10,517
age

137
00:09:11,395 --> 00:09:12,380
gender

138
00:09:13,363 --> 00:09:14,146
email

139
00:09:17,892 --> 00:09:19,524
and by deduction

140
00:09:19,919 --> 00:09:23,955
i can see that i have joe parker's email address

141
00:09:24,329 --> 00:09:26,114
so he must have been dropped

142
00:09:26,536 --> 00:09:30,248
because he has opted out of our marketing communications

143
00:09:30,515 --> 00:09:32,856
so he is considered to be blacklisted

144
00:09:33,457 --> 00:09:40,484
i could then if i wanted to go verify by looking at joe parker's actual recipient account if i wanted to

145
00:09:42,068 --> 00:09:45,623
francis jimenez i can see i'm missing his email

146
00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:46,555
so 

147
00:09:46,697 --> 00:09:50,389
he most likely was dropped because we don't have his email address

148
00:09:53,924 --> 00:09:58,911
so that concludes exercise four part five

149
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:03,507
one
